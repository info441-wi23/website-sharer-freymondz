No other student helped me on this project.

## Information

The preview will also display the main site that the url is a part of and what [type](https://ogp.me/#types) of site is.

## Style

Tweaked margins and padding for readability. Left-aligned description to also improve readability. Also rounded the corners of preview images to fit the outline of the card div. The title was stripped of the default `<a>` link styles so it's less jarring when hovering over the title.
